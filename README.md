This is my Final Group Project submitted for the UW Infomatics 103 Course, a.k.a. Social Media, Ethics, and Automation. The goal for this project was to create a Reddit Bot automation using the R language to fix a problem in social media. My group chose to create a bot to moderate content by using a sentiment analyzer and responding back to posts if they are deemed "innappropriate" or "mean."
